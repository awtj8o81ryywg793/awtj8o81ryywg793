Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an advocate of, amongst other things, free, open-source software, with interests in decentralisation, federation, local-first design, privacy, security, and more.

**Please note**, GitHub is not the forge where I craft my creations. Instead, I use other platforms, such as GitLab, as the home for my projects. I maintain a GitHub account solely to contribute to projects that consider it their home.

Find me elsewhere:

- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/oyowtyddb13pfry8)
- [GNOME GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/1o9mhgxe6kwkpxd5)
