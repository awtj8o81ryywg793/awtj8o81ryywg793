Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an advocate of free, openâ€‘source software with interests in decentralisation, federation, localâ€‘first design, privacy and security, amongst other things.

**Please note**, GitHub is not the forge where I craft my creations. Instead, I use other platforms, such as GitLab, as the home for my projects. I maintain a GitHub account solely to contribute to projects that consider it their home.

Find me elsewhere:

- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/oyowtyddb13pfry8)
- [GNOME GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/1o9mhgxe6kwkpxd5)
